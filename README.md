# BFS
Breadth First Search of a binary tree.This is used in searching a tree or graph data structures .

BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the tree layer-wise, thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). We move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.

Here's a how a BFS would traverse this tree, starting with the root.
We’d visit all the immediate children (all the nodes that are one step away from our starting node).
Then we’d move on to all those nodes’children (all the nodes that are two steps away from our starting node).
And so on until we reach the end.Breadth-first search is often compared with depth-first search.
